# Avalanche chains exploration (X-chain, C-chain)

The following code can be used for getting and outputting data about balances and transaction history in dataframe format.


## Getting data from C-chain and X-chain public APIs

The code allows to fetch data on wallet balances of ANT (Avalanche Native Tokens) from C-chain and X-chain directly from Avalanche public API.
The only input that needs to be provided is the address list.
The output is formatted and provided in Dataframe format.

## Getting data on ARC-20 tokens from C-chain using Covalent API

The code allows to get data on balances of C-chain addresses and output it in Dataframe format.

## Getting tx history of C-chain address using Covalent API

The code allows to get data on transaction history of C-chain addresses, parse it and output a detailed history of transfers and swaps performed by the particular C-chain address.

## Testing

The tests are provided at the bottom of the notebook and can be run within Jupyter.
